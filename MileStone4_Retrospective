What went wrong during the sprint cycle?
•	Getting started on the project. First sprint meeting should have been about setting the project up.

  o	Get an understanding of how much effort team members can put in for the next sprint and assign items accordingly.

•	Plan for a retrospective meeting at the end of the next sprint.
