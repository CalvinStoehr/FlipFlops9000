Project Description
Flip Flop 9000 is a platformer for mobile devices. The user plays a character with two abilities: flipping gravity and jumping. Using these abilities the user will overcome obstacles in an infinite runner 2D-scroller type setting. The goal is to last as long as possible without hitting an obstacle with increased difficulty as the time passes. Users can view their ranks against other players with a leaderboard. 


Vision Statement
Free and simple has never been more entertaining.

Motivation
There is a large demand for well designed mobile games, and making a simplistic yet addicting game can help any person pass the time while being instantly engaging. This project will give all members of the team experience in both mobile and web design, as well as databases.

Risk Mitigation Plan
Many members of our group have not had hands on application development experience as well as UI and graphics design. For the broader topics of app development, we can rely on internet resources and each other to work through the problem. For jobs such as graphic design, members of the team will specialize to create a high quality product.
